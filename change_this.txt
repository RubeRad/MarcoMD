This file is for verifying that github/pycharm is set up correctly
it can contain anything, it has nothing to do with the python project

setup process (this is complex but only has to be done once):

===== JOIN THE PROJECT ON GITHUB =====
* login to github.com (reset your password if necessary)
* accept the collaboration invitation I sent

===== SETUP GIT =====
* If necessary, download and install git for windows (free)
* Start a git bash terminal and enter these commands:
     git config --global user.name  <githubname>
     git config --global user.email <emailaddress>
         [Note these must match your github.com profile]
     ssh-keygen 
         [accept the defaults, note what directory it creates the keys]
* Go find the ssh keys that were made by the ssh-keygen command
  The *.pub file is the PUBLIC key (the other one is PRIVATE, keep it private)
  Browse to github.com, log in, go to your settings, click on SSH and GPG keys
  Open the *.pub file in notepad
  Click on New SSH Key, paste in the contents of the *.pub file
  Title is not that important, you could just put 'my laptop'
  Click Add SSH Key
  (Now your computer and github are securely linked)
* In the git bash terminal enter:
     cd /c/Users/your.account/python
        # or whatever directory you keep your python in
     git clone https://github.com/RubeRad/MarcoMD.git
        # now there will be a new subdirectory MarcoMD
     cd MarcoMD       # go into that directory
     MarcoMD.py -h    # test run; if it doesn't work, pip install pygame
     MarcoMD.py       # real run, play with keys a,s,d, j,k

===== SETUP PYCHARM =====
* If necessary, download and install PyCharm community edition (free)
* Start PyCharm
* New Project
  For the Project Interpreter part, select "Existing Interpeter" 
     and hopefully it recognizes the Python 3.x you have installed already
     and you can choose it
  For the Location, browse to the MarcoMD directory you cloned
  Click CREATE
  It will say "not empty; start a project with existing files?"
  Say Yes.
* Run/Run..., click MarcoMD, the game should run.
  After that first time with Run/Run..., the green play button should run it
  And the green bug icon should start debugging it
  (and stop at any breakpoints, let you step through, inspect variables, etc)

===== FIRST TEST COMMIT =====
* Modify this file by saying something cool at the bottom
* In git bash shell enter:
     cd /c/Users/your.account/python/MarcoMD     # or wherever
     git log          # see what recent commits have happened
     git branch       # see what branch you're on
     git status       # see what files have changed
     git diff         # see what has changed in the files
     git commit -a    # if the changes look right, commit -a[ll] changed files
     git push         # send your commit to github.com
* If that all worked (or seemed to), go to github.com and see your commit there!
